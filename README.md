The *Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System* is an advanced and automated solution designed to streamline attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. This system eliminates the need for traditional methods such as manual roll calls or RFID-based attendance, reducing errors and fraud. It captures and processes facial images in real time, leveraging machine learning algorithms to accurately recognize and verify individuals. Built using *Python, OpenCV, and deep learning models, the system ensures high accuracy and efficiency. The attendance data is stored securely in a **MySQL database, allowing easy retrieval and analysis. This project enhances security and convenience, making it ideal for **educational institutions, workplaces, and other organizations* that require reliable and contactless attendance management.
